MATLAB code for line extraction from document images.

This code implements different techniques for the task of text line extraction. The techniques are mostly based on Likforman's 2007 
"Text Line Extraction: A Survey". Implemented are Projection Profiles, Hough Transform, Active Contours, Water Flow, Minimum Spanning
Tree, Gaussian mixtures and a separation method for touching components called the "droplet Technique".
